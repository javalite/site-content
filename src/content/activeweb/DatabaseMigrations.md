Title: How to evolve your database schema

Database Migrations
===================

ActiveWeb projects' databases evolve similar to how this is done in Ruby on Rails projects. However, there are some differences too.

Please, see [DBMigrations](http://code.google.com/p/activejdbc/wiki/DBMigrations) on ActiveJDBC wiki to understand the migration process. This process would be the same whether you use ActiveJDBC or any other database technology.

This process is our recommendation based on experience. There is no hard dependency of ActiveWeb on this process.
